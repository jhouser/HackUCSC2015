Killer Apps: "Catalyze event planning with friends"
             "spend less time scheduling and more time doing"
Killer Apps: "Get out of your comfort zone"

uniqueness, 
google schemer - more of a bucket list, no longer exists
event websites - dont show you what you are availabe for, what your friends can do
doodle/surveymonkey - manually re-enter schedule for every event you plan, dont suggest events
facebook - more for your own events, cant see people are available

impact/use potential (get people to interact more),  

what are other applications?
scheduling meetings at work,
  you dont have to re-enter your calendar into surveymonkey/doodle
  modify to have temporary groups of friends/coworkers
convention, everyone wants to see different panels but still hang out.
  limit to events from a certain location/time/friendgroup
setting up skype calls 



What needs to be done:  
talk about adding email notifications when you click on an event
talk about "this doesn't replace human communication"
talk about adding price/interest/location filters
adding scraping

define your own events 
  event promoters can post events 
  

define time zones (like for setting up a skype call)
