git commands

hello!

Communicating with main repository

    git fetch upstream
    # Pulls in changes not present in your local repository, without modifying your files

    git commit -a
    # commit all changes to your files before merging (-a is for add)
    
    git merge upstream/master
    # Merges any changes fetched into your working files

    git push upstream master
    # Pushes commits to your remote repository stored on GitHub

    pull = fetch and merge

Using Branches to test ideas 
    
    to create a new branch:
    
    git checkout -b mybranch
    # Creates a new branch called "mybranch" and makes it the active branch
    
    
    to switch between branches:
    
    git checkout master
    # Makes "master" the active branch
    git checkout mybranch
    # Makes "mybranch" the active branch
    
    
    Once you are ready to use the changes made in the branch:
    
    git checkout master    # Makes "master" the active branch
    git merge mybranch
    # Merges the commits from "mybranch" into "master"
    git branch -d mybranch
    # Deletes the "mybranch" branch
